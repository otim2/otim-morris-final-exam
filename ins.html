    <h1>HOW IS WAS INSPIRED TO BECOME A DEVELOPER </h1>
    <p>Because I learned at a very early age, far before I ever could have even been exposed to computers or coding, <br> that approaching humans and the problems you can have with them leads to very different outcomes, even if the situation and <br> the approach are identical. What you say to one person might calm them down if they’re angry, for example, while saying the exact same thing to another person in an identical situation might totally enrage them. With people, there’s just no way to tell what kind of results you’re going to get.

        Then, about when I was 17 or so, came the home computer. I started learning how to code immediately, <br> I guess primarily because it was fun.
        
        But as I learned, I began to notice: Computers give you consistent output based on your input virtually every time. <br> Even if it’s not the outcome you want, because the computer is doing what you TOLD it to do instead of what you really WANTED <br> it to do, it’s consistent.
        
        That’s a great comfort to me, that there is one thing in this world that I can entirely depend on</p>
